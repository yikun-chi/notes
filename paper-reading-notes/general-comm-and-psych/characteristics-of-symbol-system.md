# Characteristics of Symbol System

[Annotated Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/130oShTy8aTNpd6kUcW-jaotewhodEfVr/view?usp=share\_link)

## Symbols and Symbol System&#x20;

* Symbols is defined as anything that can convey information, allow the extract of some semantic knowledge&#x20;
* Syntactic rules combine symbols into schemes&#x20;
* Scheme can apply to field of reference / field of reference is denoted by scheme
* Scheme + field of reference together becomes a symbol system (e.g.: Musiical performance is the field of reference for musical notation)&#x20;
* Field of reference itself can be a symbol system&#x20;
* Modes of symbol combination (e.g.: sequence of symbols) is also related to relationship among the denoted referents&#x20;

## Logical Analysis of Symbol System

### Notationality of a system&#x20;

* Notational: Both the element and the referents need to be disjoint and segregated
* Non-notational / dense: A system that entails unsegregated elements with not well segregated field of reference.&#x20;

### Description, Depiction, and Expression

* Eisner (1970)'s four classes (from description to depiction)
  1. Conventional symbols: Arbitary forms taken to repsent an event / idea
  2. Qualitative symbols: Form with physionomic property of the symbol envoking intended qualities / feeling.&#x20;
  3. Connotative symbols: Form with morphological distortions to porduce emphasis
  4. Representational symbols: Forms represent the empirical aspect of reality&#x20;
* Goodman argues that&#x20;
  1. resemblance is not required for description and depiction. For example, a picture depicting statesman as a lion represent statement without resembling him. But the same picture does not representthe animal.&#x20;
  2. Characteristics of notationality and its correlates distinguish depiction vs. description. (Nonnotational / dense system depict/represent and notation system describe)
* Expression:&#x20;
  * Based on properties that the symbol possess&#x20;
  * The symbol also must exemplify a quality metaphorically&#x20;

## Psychological Treatment of Description vs. Depiction&#x20;

* Author deviating from Goodman's view, resemblance is very important in description vs. depiction
* Referrents is normally not the actual object, but mental images / internal representation of the object
* Symbolic presentation is more similar to the referent then the opposite (A picture of a dog is more smilar to dog then dog to the picture)&#x20;
* Internal representation is constructed by preexisting encounters / knowledge

## Main Takeaway&#x20;

* Notational qualities determine it depict or describe&#x20;
* Structural congruity with internal representations determine how realistic the depiction is or how iconic the description is.&#x20;
