## Notes&#x20;

An editoral paper about sensing special issue stating the future direction of personality in the age of multi-modal sensing. Has some really good framing points about the overall field / directions. Also some good papers referenced.&#x20;

**Core Observations**&#x20;

1. Need stringent standards of rigorous psychometric testing to algorithm-based trait or state scores extracted from sensed behavioural and big data.&#x20;
   1. Move away from convergent validity, focus on nomological validity&#x20;
2. Clarity on what we are measuring or approximating and what to do with those measurement&#x20;
   1. Go beyond converging to a self-reported score. Otherwise why are we measuring those?&#x20;
   2. We should sample personality traits via other data sources too, and try to extract common variance to tap the "heart of the trait".&#x20;
3. Disentangling description, explanation and prediction&#x20;
4. Conceptual precision, formalization, and theory&#x20;
5. multidisciplinarity, collaboration, and   &#x20;focusing on ‘psychological’ aspects
