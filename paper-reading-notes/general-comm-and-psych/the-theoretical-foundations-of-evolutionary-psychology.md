## Motivation&#x20;

The goals of evolutionary psychologists are&#x20;

* The mapping of our universal human nature (high-resolution models of the evolved adaptations).&#x20;
* Reconstruct social sciences towards an accurate, natural science-based model of human nature, moving away from the&#x20;

The Standard Standard Social Science Model (SSSM) contains many incorrect assumptions, such as that the human learning system is general-purpose and content-independent

* Many evolutionary psychology models contradict this assumption
* Evolutionary psychology views culture as a manufactured product of our evolved neurocomputational programs situated in individuals living in groups&#x20;
* People have innate ideas&#x20;

## The Intellectual Origins of Evolutionary Psychology&#x20;

Three building blocks of evolutionary psychology

* Modern adaptationist revolution in theoretical evolutionary biology: The existence of antientropic functional organization involves the history of selection through adaptation&#x20;
* The rise of information theory and computational science: Logical operations can now be carried out mechanically and physically&#x20;
* The emergence of serious attempts to reconstruct the ancestral conditions, way of life, and research in animal behaviors.&#x20;

Evolutionary psychology's view on the environment

* People develop internal systems that generate responses to informational input, i.e., it is a system processing function.&#x20;

## Evolutionary Psychology&#x20;

Workflow:&#x20;

* Carefully specifying an adaptive information processing problem&#x20;
* Perform task analysis on the problem
* Generate hypotheses about the structure of the programs&#x20;

## Principles of Organic Design

Natural Selection is an Engineer that Designs Organic Machines&#x20;

* Genes have two primary ways of propagating: increase the probability of offspring, increase the reproduction of others who are more likely to carry the same gene (family)
* Adaptive behavior increases the frequency of the alleles underlying the behavior.
* Enduring conditions that create reproductive opportunities or obstacles constitute adaptive problems.
* The environment of adaptive problems + adaptive problems = Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)&#x20;

Psychology is Reverse Engineering&#x20;

* Psychologists dissect the brain's computational architecture into functionally isolable information processing units and determine how those units operate.
* Many properties of organisms are not adaptations: adaptations vs. byproduct vs. noise.&#x20;

Design Evidence&#x20;

* Research must produce evidence of a fit between the design and the proposed function.&#x20;

Theories of Good Design are a Heuristic for Discovery&#x20;

* There is a systematic method for using theories of adaptive function and principles of good design to discover new programs

Nature and Nurture from an Adaptationist Perspective&#x20;

* Innate is not the opposite of learned
* Any learned behavior is the joint product of innate equipment interacting with environmental input.
* A function is generally specialized for a domain and can be activated after birth.&#x20;
* Behavior is caused by evolved mechanisms operating on information from the environment, so there is no need to distinguish between genetically determined vs. environment-determined.&#x20;
* Species' developmentally relevant environment is just as much the creation of the evolutionary process as the genes are&#x20;
* Adaptations can be conceptualized as operating in two different modes: functional (performing its evolved function) and organizational mode (constructing the adaptation and furnishing it with information)
* Selection interacting with sexual recombination tends to impose at the genetic level near uniformity in the latent or potential functional design.&#x20;
* Behavior geneticists explore the extent to which differences in their genes account for differences among individuals. Evolutionary psychologists explore the design of the universal evolved psychological and neural architecture.&#x20;
* Genetic variability tends to be predominantly nonadaptive or maladaptive.&#x20;

Evolutionary vs. traditional psychology&#x20;

* Evolutionary psychologists expect a mind paced with domain-specific, content-rich programs specialized for solving ancestral problems.&#x20;
* Each domain-specialized mechanism will be part of a vertically integrated system.&#x20;

## Computational Adaptationist Approaches to Motivation and Emotion&#x20;

A content-free general-purpose system is a bad design

* A content-free general-purpose system is not good at solving anything well&#x20;
* Too many combinations of domains mean without a domain-specialized learning mechanism, we wouldn't be learning at all
* A domain-specific learning system can infer cues and information based on the domain
* From domain to domain, adaptive behaviors are widely different. So, one procedure can not solve all.&#x20;

The motivational system involves a series of evolved content-specific conceptual elements.&#x20;

## Emotions as a Solution to the Short-term Problem of Mechanism Coordination&#x20;

* &#x20;



Question&#x20;

1. What is motivational domain vs. motivation. What is the relationship between motivation and value in terms of general vs. domain specific.&#x20;
2. Why does cognitive science intrinsically involves motivation, can it just be about content-specific conceptual element that are general purpose?&#x20;
3. Why does emotions have to be the orchestration process, not attention / sailency, and why can it not be reducible to any one category of effects?&#x20;
4. How are emotion (affective? ), cognition (cognitive), and behavioral system fit together?&#x20;
