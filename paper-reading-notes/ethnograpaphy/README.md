### Gathering Rich Data&#x20;

Method matters in ground theory. It impacts what we end up seeing and collecting. Grounded Theory starts with some initial concepts to collect and analytically think about the data. It then follows the lead defined in the data. The goal is to understand and interpret the view.&#x20;

Grounded theory ethnography focus on phenomenon or process. Two methods mentioned are intensive interviewing and and textual analysis.&#x20;
