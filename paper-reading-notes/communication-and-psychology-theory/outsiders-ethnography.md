## Chapter 1&#x20;

Discuss on what is the meanning of "deviant". Key points:&#x20;

* The definition of deviance is hard: Some definition (e.g., statistical) will include people who are "slightly deviant" and also people who are "very deviant). Some definition (e.g., societal harm) involves rules that are inconsistent / determined with varying motivations.&#x20;
* Deviants are not a homogeneous population. They only share the experience of labelling as outsiders. Deviance is not a quality of a person but a consequence of other's rule enforcement&#x20;
* Deviance is a very conditional act, such as conditioned on timing, population, and the population of rule enforcer.&#x20;

## Chapter 5

There are inherent conflict between free self-expression and outside pressure. Musicians create isolation to keep distances physically and mentally between themselves and the squares&#x20;
