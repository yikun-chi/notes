# Toward a Structure- and Process-Integrated Trait as Density Distributions

## Abstract

Three experience-sampling studies explored the distributions of Big-Five-relevant states (behavior) across 2 to 3 weeks of everyday life. Within-person variability was high, such that the typical individual regularly and routinely manifested nearly all levels of all traits in his or her everyday behavior. Second, individual differences in central tendencies of behavioral distributions were almost perfectly stable. Third,  amount of behavioral variability (and skew and kurtosis) were revealed as stable individual differences. Finally, amount of within-person variability in extraversion was shown to reflect individual differences in reactivity to extraversion-relevant situational cues. Thus, decontextualized and noncontingent Big-Five content is highly useful for descriptions of individuals' density distributions as wholes. Simultaneously, contextualized and contingent personality units (e.g., conditional traits, goals) are needed for describing the considerable within-person variation.&#x20;

## Theoretical Framing&#x20;

### **Core message:**

&#x20;Individual behavior over time forms a distribution about personality and the entire distribution matters.&#x20;

### Motivations&#x20;

Three presumptions that motivated the framing :&#x20;

1. The average individual routinely and regularly expresses all levels of traits, and this within-person variability is predictable as individual differences in reactions to situational cues.&#x20;
2. Although single behaviors are less predictable, the mean of the distribution is among the most predictable variables in psychology.&#x20;
3. Parameters beyond the mean are also meaningful aspects of personality (e.g., variability is itself a stable individual-differences characteristic) &#x20;

Three benefits of examining personality as a whole distribution over time:&#x20;

1. Improve understanding of how trait content manifests in everyday beahavior, and do individuals differ in such manifestation?&#x20;
2. Integrate both structural/noncontingent approaches and process or contingent approaches.
   * Structural approaches: Explaining behavior through the stability of aggregated mean. (What kind of people tend to do what)&#x20;
   * Process approaches: Explaining behavior through within-person variability. (What people tend to do in different situations)
3. Reveal additional aspects of everyday behavior over time as relevant to personlity.
