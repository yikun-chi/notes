# Cost Conscious? The Neural and Behavioral Impact of Price Primacy on Decision Making

## Positioning&#x20;

The order effect of information presentation can influence decision&#x20;

Exposure to stimulus results in immediate affective preference formation&#x20;

People don't evaluate the price in a vacuum. It can have an impact on how a product is evalulated, such as focusing on the overall worth of a product, etc. &#x20;

## Conceptual and Empirical&#x20;

### Hypothesis

* H1: Price vs. product presentation order -> decision-making&#x20;
* H2: Price primacy (presenting price first) -> increase considerations of product's monetary worth&#x20;
* H3a: Price primacy -> increase activity patterns related to perceived monetary value in MPFC
* H3b: Price primacy -> does not decrease activity patterns related to product value in MPFC and preference in the NAcc
* H4: Price primacy -> increase the likelihood of purchasing utilitarian product&#x20;

### Experiment:&#x20;

* Choice tasks of deciding purchase
* Price first / Product first picture - Joint picture - Decision picture&#x20;
* Preference survey for product post-choice task&#x20;

### Result

* Price did not shift value, simply make one aspect (monetary) more sailent&#x20;



&#x20;H1: Changing the sequence in which price and product information are encountered changes the decision-making process. H2: In contrast to product primacy, price primacy causes a qualitative shift in how product value is determined, increasing considerations of an item's (monetary) worth.
