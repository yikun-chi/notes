## Framing&#x20;

The mission of personality psychology is theoretical, empirical, and institutional:&#x20;

* Theoretical: account for individuals' characteristic pattern of thought, emotion, and behavior, together with the psychological mechanism
* Empirical: gather and analyze data that reveal how persons, situations, and behaviors are interrelated, and to develop psychometric tools to clarify the nature of these relations&#x20;
* Institutional mission: provide an integrative force in an era of scientific specialization and fragmentation.&#x20;

## Existing Paradigm TLDR&#x20;

### Trait

Two empirical recognitions

* The behavior of a sample of individuals observed in one situation correlates with their behavior in a second situation, with a magnitude that routinely reaches $$r=0.4$$
  * Some nuggets about the correlation size&#x20;
    * The practice of squaring correlations to interpret their size is misleading (Correlation and the coefficient      &#x20;of determination, by Ozer in Psychological Bulletin)&#x20;
    * A 0.4 correlation represents 70% accuracy in predicting a dichotomous criterion ( A simple, general purpose display of magnitude of experimental effect by Rosenthal & Rubin in Journal of Educational Psychology)&#x20;
* Behavioral consistency and change are orthogonal phenomena. i.e., differences across situations do not imply that individual differences do not exist.&#x20;
