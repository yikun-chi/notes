# A First Look at Communication Theory

Annotated Link

Notes are taken with Stanford COMM 208 Media Processes and Effects with Prof. Robby Ratan&#x20;

## Objective vs. Interpretive Theory&#x20;

Evaluation criteria for objective theory&#x20;

* Prediction of future&#x20;
* Explanation of data&#x20;
* Relative simplicity&#x20;
* Testable hypothesis&#x20;
* Practical utility&#x20;
* Quantitative research (experiment, survey ...)&#x20;

Evaluation criteria for interpretive theory&#x20;

* Clarification of values: what kind of values are built into the theory and of the author&#x20;
* New understanding of people&#x20;
* Aesthetic appeal&#x20;
* Community of aggrement&#x20;
* Reform of society: aim to generate change&#x20;
* Qulitative research (textual analysis, ethnography...)&#x20;

## Media Effect Theories&#x20;

Start with the Magic Bullet Hypothesis (1940s) where media effect is conceptualized as a hyperdemic needle.&#x20;

In 1950s - 60s, the field transit to limited effect approaches, such as:&#x20;

* Selective Exposure: people only attend to aggreable media and avoid contradiction (Cognitive Dissonance)&#x20;
* Uses and Gratification: People choose media to fulfill their needs, which differ by individual and medium&#x20;
* Indirect effect: two-step or mlti-step flow model of communication, such as
  * Media -> Opinion Leaders -> Masses&#x20;
  * Media -> Masses -> Opinion leader validation I

In 1970s - 90s, the field transit to Powerful-Effect Models&#x20;

* Explanatory linkes became clearer&#x20;
* Excitation Transfer Theory&#x20;
* Social Cognitive Theory: vicarious experience with attention, rentention, motivation give raise to learning&#x20;

## Chapter 29 Cultivation Theory of George Gerbner&#x20;

Summary: TV power comes from symbolic content. Heavy TV viewer's perception of reality is influenced by TV&#x20;

(Knowledge vs. perception??)&#x20;

Three components

* Institutional analysis: why companies produce the content that they are producing&#x20;
* Message system analysis: analysis of the content&#x20;
* Cultivation analysis: how TV content affect viewer's conception of social reality&#x20;

Mainstreaming: The bluring and blending process of heavy TV viewers forming a single homogenous group&#x20;

Resonance: The condition that exists when viewer's real life environment is like the world of TV, makes viewer more susceptible to TV&#x20;

Critique:&#x20;

* Lack of testability on causal directions&#x20;
