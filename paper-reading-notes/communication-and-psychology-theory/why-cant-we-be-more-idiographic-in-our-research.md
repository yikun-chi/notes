[Article Link   ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26158824/)[Annotaed Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10GX5jrxMI9I6H\_nu\_FiXwgc13z\_R\_bEm/view?usp=sharing)

## Key Concepts:&#x20;

* idiographic approach: Carefully tracking one / few individual for a long time&#x20;
* nomothetic approach: Assemble large groups of individuals and measure mean&#x20;

## Core Arguments&#x20;

* Idiographic approach used to be popular in early stage of experimental psychology and middle of the last century&#x20;
* Nomothetic strategy is now the dominant option, e.g.: RCT&#x20;
* There are many challenges to the generalizability of nomothetic approach, normally in the form of methodology critic.&#x20;
* Advance in idiographic method now allows and calls for better integration of both approaches. &#x20;
