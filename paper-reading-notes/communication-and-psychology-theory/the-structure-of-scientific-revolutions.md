## Overall Discussion (COMM 317 with Professor James S. Fishkin)

* In a way Kuhn backed out a bit on his original claim of anti-cumulative science a bit.
* One of the greatest debate around his theory is the incommensurability of the paradigm shift&#x20;
* It is really hard to just do extradentary research. Often is stumbled across from doing normal research. But certain ways of generating research questions are more effective.&#x20;

## Chapter 1: Introduction: A Role for History

* Historians are finding it harder to 1) research into the accumulation view of the scientific development history and 2) distinguish the scientific component and mistake component of past theories.&#x20;
* The new focus for historians is to display the historical integrity of that science in its own time&#x20;
* Methodology alone is not sufficient to generate a unique substantive conclusion to scientific questions. Background matters
* New theory forms as a slow process to challenge existing theories, and it take time for new facts and theory to be integrated into existing systems&#x20;

## Chapter 2: The Route to Normal Science

We can divide a field's history into pre-paradigm and post-paradigm.&#x20;

Pre-paradigm:&#x20;

* No single dominating paradigm&#x20;
* All facts that could pertain to the development seem equally relevant. So early fact-gathering consists of causal observations, experiments, and data from other established crafts. Seems chaotic. Often multiple scientists will attempt to interpret similar but not exactly the same phenomenon from different perspectives.&#x20;

Post-paradigm:&#x20;

* Consecutive scientific revolution transit one paradigm to another
* Existence of a set of principles that scientists no longer need to explain or justify when continuing their research
* With each paradigm the definition of the field become more rigid and clear
* Research report starting to become impossible for laymen to access

## Chapter 3: The Nature of Normal Science

A paradigm is successful because it promise more discoverable success. People generally choose to work on this mopping up operation until is is more efficient to think of alternatives.&#x20;

Three categories of scientific investigations

* Work on facts that the paradigm has shown to be important, increasing its precision or larger context&#x20;
* Work on facts that can be compared directly with predictions from the paradigm theory&#x20;
* Work on articulate the paradigm theory

## Chapter 4: Normal Science as Puzzle-solving

Normal science rarely aim to produce major innovations. The process is like solving a puzzle:&#x20;

* Result is determined, and maybe of no value, but the process is fun&#x20;
* There are set of rules governing how to obtain the result&#x20;

## Chapter 5: The Priority of Paradigms

This chapter separates paradigms from full set of rules. Kuhn argues that&#x20;

* Paradigm determine normal science without discoverable full set of rules
* people relate to paradigm by resemblance, and this process is obtained because education is never in a vacuum
* Because explicit rules do not exist, the field of a particular science often has little coherence

## Chapter 6: Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries

Discovery of anomaly fact (observational) and new theory (conceptual) takes time to completely integrate (it's a process). The process of normal science, through continuously advancing precise measurement and expectation, actually give ground to the possibility to discover anomalies. Those anomalies after extended, but not necessarily prolonged assimilation, will lead to new theory and paradigm.&#x20;

## Chapter 7: Crisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories&#x20;

New theory emerges when a paradigm suffers from consistent failure in puzzle solving activities (the crisis).&#x20;

## Chapter 8: The Response to Crisis&#x20;

Not all questions can lead to paradigm change. Once questions and anomalies became large enough, the end is one of the three options: paradigm wins, declare no solution, and new theory emerge. In crisis, scientist will start to loosen paradigm by introduce variations, and also try to make the anomaly more defined and pronounced.&#x20;

Note nothing in this process is guaranteed accumulative.&#x20;

### Chapter 9: The Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions

The parallel between political revolution and scientific revolution&#x20;

* Existing paradigm cease to function adequately (crisis)&#x20;
* Only visible for practitioner
* The choose between paradigm must go beyond scientific arguments

New paradigm does not have to be in directly conflict with predecessors, but cumulation is improbable.&#x20;

Argues against the somewhat Positivism way of thinking that theory only applies to already tested facts.&#x20;

Overall talks about the scientific revolution as a concept.&#x20;

### Chapter 10: Revolutions as Change of World View&#x20;

Argues for scientific revolution leads to change in perception of the world, much more than mere interpretation.&#x20;

### Chapter 11: The Invisibility of Revolutions&#x20;

Argues for the invisibility of scientific revolution. Textbooks are constructed post revolution about an new paradigm, so easier to be seen and written as the cumulative history.&#x20;

### Chapter 12: The Resolution of Revolution

Scientist often not switch paradigm, or switching due to persuasion(such as aesthetic) instead of proof

### Chapter 13: Progress through Revolution&#x20;

New paradigms are often not comparable to old ones. We cannot assume the that revolution brings progress. The sense of progress is generally fake.&#x20;
