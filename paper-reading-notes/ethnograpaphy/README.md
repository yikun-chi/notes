## Grounded Theory

### Intro&#x20;

Grounded theory is a set of guidelines for collecting and analyzing qualitative data to construct theories that are based on data&#x20;

Abductive analysis embrace prior knowledge and focus on surprising data

### Gathering Rich Data&#x20;

Method matters in ground theory. It impacts what we end up seeing and collecting. Grounded Theory starts with some initial concepts to collect and analytically think about the data. It then follows the lead defined in the data. The goal is to understand and interpret the view.&#x20;

Grounded theory ethnography focus on phenomenon or process. Two methods mentioned are intensive interviewing and and textual analysis.&#x20;

## Interview

Tips:&#x20;

1. &#x20;Listen carefully and talk as little as possible&#x20;
2. &#x20;Keep in mind what you want to know and why you want to know it (to help with deciding when to probe more and when to move on)&#x20;
3. &#x20;Be a proactive interviewer&#x20;
4. &#x20;Assure respondents that there aren't any right or wrong answers&#x20;
5. &#x20;Use a participant's own words. Consider not to asking probes that put your own spin on what the respondent said&#x20;
6. Reuse Effective probes&#x20;
7. Focus on learning the subjective meanings that events ore experience have for respondent&#x20;
8. Don't be afraid to ask a question that draw on your own knowledge&#x20;
9. Keep thinking while you are listening&#x20;
10. Return to a theme raised by a respondent if you want further information&#x20;
11. Be mindful of power inequalities&#x20;
12. Take control with overly talkative respondents&#x20;
13. Expect overly succinct respondent and probe&#x20;
14. Try to balance digging deep and moving on&#x20;
15. Develop a plan to deflect questions&#x20;
16. Check to see whether you have asked all of your questions&#x20;
17. Listen for great quotes but keep your expectation realistic

## Philosophy on Sampling&#x20;

Attempts to solve generalizability in interviewing, such as random sampling or finding representatives, are misguided and fruitless. Random sampling might deal with needing large numbers and unresponse bias. Finding representatives are influenced by conceptual image of "representative"&#x20;

Alternative 1: Extending the extended case method&#x20;

* The Berkeley school (Michael Burawoy): objective is to understand larger forces shaping conditions in the case. Unique cases are especially interesting. This can be used to improve theory, but does not provide a way to make empirical assessments relevant to other theories or judge the quality of hypothesis.&#x20;
* Manchester (Clyde Mitchell): Focus on "scientific inference". Case studies can be used to make logical hypothesis (A is doing B because of C)

Alternative 2: Sequential interviewing&#x20;

* Focus on case sutdy logic. Continue to interview until case is complete. Each interview is designed to obtain new information that previous interview did not uncover.&#x20;

## Philosophy on Interviewing&#x20;

Inteterview-only studies have the danger of missing certain connections and ignoring behavior to report mismatch. Ethnographer place accounts into the context of action and can achieve more holistic result.&#x20;
