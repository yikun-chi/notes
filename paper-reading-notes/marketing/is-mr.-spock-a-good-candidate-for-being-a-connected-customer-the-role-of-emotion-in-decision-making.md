# Is Mr. Spock a Good Candidate for Being a Connected Customer? The Role of Emotion in Decision Making

Evolution of the customer value proposition (CVP)&#x20;

* 1980s to 1990s: CVP = value from benefits+ value from pricing&#x20;
* late 1990s: emotion is added as the third component&#x20;
  * emotion can be shaped independently from benefit&#x20;
  * emotion is a key component of a brand's inventory&#x20;
* Post-1990s: emotion as an essential foundation&#x20;

Decision quality, emotions and the brain&#x20;

* what is a good decision?&#x20;
  * Normative benchmark: axioms of dominance (people choose an inferior product) and transitivity
  * Output driven, good decision is one where the decision marker is satisfied with, confident about&#x20;
* Emotion can shift the evaluation of attribute information in favor of the emotionally enriched option. This means sometimes logically trade-off situation (no dominant option) will become dominant due to emotionally driven biased evaluation

A View into the Future&#x20;

* Developing appropriate measures for the emotion component. e.g,: face tracking, skin conductance etc.&#x20;
* Exploring array of tactical means of shaping emotion. i.e.,: additional arousal mechanism in addition to audio visual&#x20;
* Gaining richer insights into the CVP by examining interaction effects of emotion, benefit, pricing across various product type and other moderators.&#x20;
