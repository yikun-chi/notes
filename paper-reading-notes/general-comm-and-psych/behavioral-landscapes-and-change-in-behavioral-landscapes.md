# Behavioral Landscapes and Change in Behavioral Landscapes

[Annotated Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bg5YKw5\_NBSz4FObSfulqXGQTtW7rLh1/view?usp=drive\_link)

&#x20;

## Core Idea

* Draw a parallel between behavioral (constructed from observations) and geographic landscapes.&#x20;
  * Extend the notion of personality as density distributions from Fleeson, 2001.&#x20;
* Visualize the landscapes and highlight different geographical features.&#x20;
* Show the change of landscape across time.&#x20;

## Notes

* Geological landscape vs. topological features&#x20;
