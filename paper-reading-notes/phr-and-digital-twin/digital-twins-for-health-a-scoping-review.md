# Digital Twins for Health A Scoping Review

[Annotated Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1humqmWODIrI2MaPt3icIeoslLBLbEpKv/view?usp=sharing)

**Definition & Character of digital twin:**

* A virtual representation of objects&#x20;
* Faithfully mirror the real-world system in real-time, analyze its behavior and provide predictive insights using advanced simulation, ML and reasoning.&#x20;

**Types of Digital Twin**&#x20;

* Static twin: A digital replica of a physical system
* Mirror (functional) twin: A static twin with dynamic behavior capabilities&#x20;
* Shadow (self-adaptive) twin: A functional twin with the capacity to acquire real-time data and update the model&#x20;
* Intelligent (extended/cognitive/physical avatars)  twin: Self-adaptive twin with a degree of artificial intelligence that has autonomy with learning, reasoning, knowledge, and acting capabilities.&#x20;

**Different types of DTs for healthcare:**&#x20;

* Provided a somewhat OK overview of different applications.&#x20;

**(Thoughts): LLM vs. ML models**&#x20;

* ML models have limited functions. A prediction model can only do prediction. However, if we replace the inference part with an LLM, the final product will be moved into the realm of a digital twin.&#x20;
* Digital phenotype: patterns in human body and behavior. (Input to DT construction).&#x20;
