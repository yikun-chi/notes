### Problem of Demarcation of Science Statements

Sections 1, 2, and 3 established and provided context on the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, refutability, or testability. Stressed that this is for demarcation only. It has nothing to do with meaning.&#x20;

### Problem of Induction

Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 supported Hume's refutation of inductive inference. But disagree with Hume's psychological arguments by pointing out some observations and logic infinite regress problems. Proposed the true process is conjectures (based on prior events, inborn expectation and tendency to draw regularities) and refutations (falsifiability). Relates dogmatic attitude (tendency to draw regularities) to confirmation bias. Specify role of deductive logic in falsifiability.&#x20;

### Problem the Logic of Science

Sections 8, 9, and 10 connected the problem of demarcation and the problem of induction. Point out that the theory's acceptance is only temporary (never accept null hypothesis, only failure to reject null).&#x20;

## The Nature of Normal Science

A paradigm is successful because it prompise more discoverable success. People generally choose to work on this mopping up operation until is is more efficient to think of alternatives.&#x20;

Three categories of scientific investigations

* Work on facts that the paradigm has shown to be important, increasing its precision or larger context&#x20;
* Work on facts that can be compred directly with predictions from the paradigm theory&#x20;
* Work on articulate the paradigm theory

## Normal Science as Puzzle-solving
