# Is Mr. Spock a Good Candidate for Being a Connected Customer? The Role of Emotion in Decision Making

Evolution of the customer value proposition (CVP)&#x20;

* 1980s to 1990s: CVP = value from benefits+ value from pricing / cost
  * cost can be intangible, such as friction cost&#x20;
* late 1990s: emotion is added as the third component&#x20;
  * emotion can be shaped independently from the benefit&#x20;
  * emotion is a key component of a brand's inventory&#x20;
* Post-1990s: emotion as an essential foundation&#x20;
  * So $$\beta_1E * [\beta_2V_b + \beta_3V_c]$$ instead of additive or even different interaction values between benefit and cost&#x20;

Decision quality, emotions, and the brain&#x20;

* what is a good decision?&#x20;
  * Normative benchmark: axioms of dominance (people choose an inferior product) and transitivity
  * Output-driven, a good decision is one where the decision maker is satisfied with, confident about&#x20;
* Emotion can shift the evaluation of attribute information in favor of the emotionally enriched option. This means sometimes, a trade-off situation (no dominant option) will become dominant due to emotionally driven biased evaluation.

A View into the Future&#x20;

* Developing appropriate measures for the emotion component. e.g.,: face tracking, skin conductance, etc.&#x20;
* Exploring an array of tactical means of shaping emotion. i.e., additional arousal mechanism in addition to audio-visual&#x20;
* Gaining richer insights into the CVP by examining interaction effects of emotion, benefit, and pricing across various product types and other moderators.&#x20;

## Comments from Baba

Two aspects of any decisions:&#x20;

* pre-decision (due diligence phase): reason-driven, the goal is to reduce biases&#x20;
  * due diligence is about creating the search set and evaluation criteria&#x20;
* post-decision: emotion-driven, the goal is to increase confidence&#x20;
  * confidence is important for customers (brand loyalty), leaders (persuasive, inspiring, placebo effect), &#x20;

A good decision is based on different things depending on the stage (pre vs. post)&#x20;
