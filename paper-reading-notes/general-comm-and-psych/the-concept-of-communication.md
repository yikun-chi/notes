## Abstract

This essay examines multitudinous definitions of ‘communication’ in the light of the meaning of ‘concept’ as reflected in the literature of the philosophy of science. The examination produced 15 main themes from the definitions. Among the 15 conceptual components there are three upon which the definitions rather critically divide. These three points of conceptual split are examined for their impact on theory construction in communication. Some suggestions are made for conceptual clarification.

## 15 Conceptual Components of communication&#x20;

Note that in the literature reviewed, almost every definition of communication contains multiple listed components&#x20;

1. **Symbols / Verbal / Speech**
2. **Understading:** "Communication is the process by which we understand others and in turn endeavor to be understdood by them."&#x20;
3. **Interaction/Relationship/Social Process**
4. **Reduction of Uncertainity**&#x20;
5. **Process:** "Communication: the transmission of information, ideas ..... It is the act or process of transmission that is usually called communication."&#x20;
6. **Transfer / Transmission / Interchange:** "We use the word “communication” sometimes to refer to what is so transferred, sometimes to the means by which it is transferred, sometimes to the whole process. "&#x20;
7. **Linking: Binding:** “Communication is the process that links discontinuous parts of the living world to one another.”
8. **Commonality:** "It is a process that makes common to two or several what was the monopoly of one or some"&#x20;
9. **Channel / Carrier / Means / Route**&#x20;
10. **Replicating Memories**: “Communication is the process of conducting the attention of another person for the purpose of replicating memories.”
11. **Discriminative Response / Behavior Modifying / Response Change:** “Communication is the discriminatory response of an organism to a stimulus.”
12. **Stimuli:** “Every communication act is viewed as a transmission of information, consisting of a discriminative stimuli, from a source to a recipient.”
13. **Intentional**&#x20;
14. **Time / Situation**&#x20;
15. **Power**&#x20;

Across those 15 components, there are three areas where the most critical divide happen. They are&#x20;

1. The level of observation (e.g.: does it only include human? )
2. The presence or absenec of intent on the part of the sender&#x20;
3. The normative judgment (e.g.: Is the communication successful)&#x20;
