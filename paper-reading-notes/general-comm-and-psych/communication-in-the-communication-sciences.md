## The Grid&#x20;

level fields and variable fields together form a grid. This grid can be used to situation reserch as well as career.&#x20;

Going from low order (e.g.: bio) to higher order (e.g.: Psych) follows reductionist thinking, where scholars seek to explain phenomena of the next higher level with theories containing terms from the low level only. Going lateral on the grid follows analogic thinking.&#x20;
