## Communication as a Social Science&#x20;

**Introduction:**&#x20;

Comm are born out of other social sciences, but then grow to its own. People like Carl Hovland, Harold Lasswell, Paul Lazarsfeld, Kurt Lewin were key figures.&#x20;

**Communication Subdisciplines within the Social Sciences:**&#x20;

Many subdiscplines of comm , such as interpersonal comm, mass comm existed in other social sciences than become part of comm.&#x20;

**Social Science Disciplines:**&#x20;

Distinctions in social sciences are partually natural, partially arbitrary. Berelson proposed original sub-discipline division: anthro, econ, history, political, psych and socio.&#x20;

**Level Frields:**&#x20;

1. Behavioral Science
   1. Anthropology
      1. Social Anthropology&#x20;
   2. Sociology
      1. Social Psychology
   3. Psychology&#x20;
      1. Physiological psychology&#x20;
2. Biological Science&#x20;
   1. Physiology
   2. Biology&#x20;
      1. Biochemistry
3. Physical Science
   1. Chemistry&#x20;
   2. Physics&#x20;

**Variable Fields**

* Fundamental Variable Fields&#x20;
  * Cybernetics&#x20;
  * System Research
  * Communication Research&#x20;
* High-order Variable Fields&#x20;
  * Political Science
  * Economics
  * Business Research
  * Education Research&#x20;
  * etc.&#x20;

**The Grid:**&#x20;

level fields and variable fields together form a grid. This grid can be used to situation reserch as well as career.&#x20;

Going from low order (e.g.: bio) to higher order (e.g.: Psych) follows reductionist thinking, where scholars seek to explain phenomena of the next higher level with theories containing terms from the low level only. Going lateral on the grid follows analogic thinking.&#x20;

## Communication Indicators

Skipped parts:&#x20;

* Demogrpahic&#x20;

* Uses and Gratifications (Lazarsfeld's group, 1940s)
