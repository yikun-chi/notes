# Media Repertoires as a Result of Selective Media Use

[Annotated Link ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yZFTgAyf1aKMP2l4widz247iKxr8vRYY/view?usp=drive\_link)

## Abstract

This article sets out to provide a conceptual contribution to theoretical and empirical work on the level of media repertoires. We will first discuss theoretical approaches which allow for an explanation of media repertoires and relate them to the most prominent approaches to selective audience behavior. Secondly, in order to empirically analyze media repertoires we propose a combination of secondary analyses of existing surveys on media use and qualitative studies on the internal ‘architecture’ of these repertoires and their practical meaning in the user’s everyday life. These proposals for secondary analyses are illustrated by two examples based on different datasets and referring to different levels of analysis.

## Introduction&#x20;

Traditionally, research on media use and selectivity often analyzes single aspects of media-related behavior (e.g., amount of use of certain media or content). The article calls for analysis of patterns over time, focusing on how people combine contacts with different media and different kinds of content.

* Repertoire-oriented perspective challenges that media use can be conceptualized appropriately in terms of single variables&#x20;
* A meta-level of gratifications or media use theory needs to be developed. For example, how patterns of mood or mood over time influences things instead of a single moment.&#x20;

Empirical work skipped.&#x20;
