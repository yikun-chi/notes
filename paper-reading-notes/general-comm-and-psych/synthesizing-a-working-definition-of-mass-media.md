## Abstract

Media scholars as well as the public frequently use the terms “mass communication” and “mass media”, but the meaning of these terms is often ambiguous. While it is assumed that everyone knows what these terms mean, the few scholars who attempt to define these terms struggle to capture the essence of their meaning without including elements that are faulty, and this task is becoming even more difficult in the new media environment. We are left with the troubling question: What are the “mass” media? This review constructs an answer to this question in a four step process. The first step features a critical analysis of the literature to identify definitional elements used by scholars. These definitional elements are subjected to four screens that evaluate their utility in a second step. The third step adds elements missing from the literature so as to make the eventual definition more useful in the new media environment. Finally, the fourth step features the construction of a working definition of “mass” media.

## New Media Environment

* Technological convergence: different platform contains all shared messages. E.g.: TV shows can be watched on cell phone, TV, Laptop, and even gaming consoles.&#x20;
* Interactivity
* Information saturation: competition for attention&#x20;
* Shift in marking perspective: build for initial attraction, and then condition audience for repeated exposure

## 10 Definition elements&#x20;

1. (Channel): Reach audiences within a relatively short time, even simultaneously&#x20;
2. (Channel): Make messages public&#x20;
3. (Channel): Extend the availability of messages in time and space&#x20;
4. (Sender): Complex organization&#x20;
5. (Sender): Use standardized practices to disseminate content&#x20;
6. (Sender): Actively promote itself in order to attract as many audience members as possible&#x20;
7. (Sender): Condition audience members for habitual repeated exposure&#x20;
8. (Audience): Widely dispersed geographically&#x20;
9. (Audience): Aware of the public character of what they are seeing or hearing&#x20;
10. (Audience): Encounter messages in a variety of exposure states but most often in a state of automaticity

## Some Thoughts&#x20;

1. The author make clear distinction between mass media (e.g.: Facebook) and content contributor (people). However, in the age of influencer era, many of the decisions around senders (e.g.: who to reach to, when, how, how interactive) are determined by the content creator instead of platform. In a way, are we putting too much emphasis on platform like Facebook? Just a random thoughts, what if we add to our frame of thinking, not only think about "how TikTok is spreading certain media" (focusing on platform), but also "Why are certain content so trendy on TikTok and produced by so many" (audience behaviors) .&#x20;
