## Against 'Normal Science' by J.W.N. Watkins

There are conflict between Kuhn and Popper's view. Kuhn's vision of "Normal Science" is considered to be unscientific in Popper's view. Kuhn's vision of "Extraordinary Science" (an anomaly) is considered to be the norm in Popper's view.&#x20;

Based on Kuhn's view, paradigm-switching must means post-hoc view that empirical pressure on the old paradigm become intolerable, but many examples of an empirically successful theory being superseded by more testable theory (thus supporting Popper's view).&#x20;
