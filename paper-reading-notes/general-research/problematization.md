## Problematization&#x20;

* Gap-spotting studies reinforce existing theories, incapable of producing high impact.&#x20;
* Genuine problematization is to challenge the assumption of one's own position and generate alternative assumption from there.
* It requires a dialectical interrogation of home position, other theoretical stances and domain of literature.&#x20;
* Example: First scrutinize the way theories have emerged historically and on what assumptions and conditions they rest, then question their underlying assumptions and generate new inquiries.&#x20;

## Five Assumptions Type

* **In-house** : exist within a particular school of thought and shared and accepted as unproblematic.&#x20;
* **Root metaphor**: Broader images of a particular subject matter.  &#x20;
* **Paradigm** : Ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions.&#x20;
* **Ideology** : Political, moral and gender related assumptions&#x20;
* **Field**: Broader set of assumptions about a specific subject matter that are shared by several different school of thoughts.&#x20;

## Methodological Principles for Identifying, Articulating and Challenging Assumptions&#x20;

1. Identifying a domain of literture
   * More narrow literature coverage and in-depth compare to gap spotting&#x20;
   * Focus on path-define studies, authoritative summaries or look at more reent influential pieces&#x20;
2. Identifying and articulating the assumptions underlying this domain&#x20;
   * In-house: scrutinizing internal debates and the interfaces between a specific group of authors&#x20;
   * Root metaphor: identifying the basic image or metaphor and detecting or producing alternative possible confrontational metaphors
   * Paradigm assumptions: familiar with alternative views&#x20;
   * Field: look at discussion across different schools that are disagreeing with each other and what they agree on and don't talk about it&#x20;
3. Evaluating the assumptions&#x20;
   * False, misleading, narrow&#x20;
   * Does not add much intellectual value&#x20;
   * Practical value of an assumption&#x20;
4. Developing an alternative assumption ground&#x20;
   * Call for a borader overview and a broader set of considerations
   * Some techniques: counter-induction, analogy, making a reversal&#x20;
   * Alternative should point to a new pathway for theoretical exploration or empirical study&#x20;
5. Considering alternative in relation to its audience&#x20;
6. Evaluating the alternative assumption ground&#x20;
   * Is it interesting? Accept some, and challenge some&#x20;
