# Personal Knowledge

## Chapter 1: Objectivity ([Annotated Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nl4VeVaekSuajx4OSrUtqHKhbBMXaq8b/view?usp=share\_link))

* There is no absolute objectivity otherwise we would be all studying space dust.&#x20;
* To say scientific theory is objective is to say general theory is closer to objectivity than sensory experience.
  * Theory can be right or wrong about the world&#x20;
  * Theory is not influenced by personal illusions&#x20;
  * Theory is constructed without regard to idiosyncratic approach to experience&#x20;
* Theory (objectivity) has implications beyond what the creater even know, just like how solar centeric system can leads to many other implications.
* Discussion around positivistic conception of science (science is only a summary of experience. If it can not be experience or tested, then it is not science) and how relativity, despite convention perception, is actually a rejection to such claim.&#x20;
* Science can start with intuitive understanding and observance into the rationality of nature.&#x20;
* Preference for simplicity should redefine simplicity to be perceived by the expert (e.g.: relativity is not simple for outsiders)

## Chapter 4: Skills ([Annotated Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KM7hQBd1UZGF\_sn7Uknxqk-Ciibgsp33/view?usp=share\_link))&#x20;

* Many skilful performer follows rules that they don't know.
* dustructive resonaning: deny the fesibility of something because it is not explained by accepted framework could lead to false negative, but is still indispensable.&#x20;
* There are skills and connoisseurship that cannot be specified, only observed and learned by experience and tradition.&#x20;
* There are two kind of mutually exclusive awareness: subsidiary (I know am holding the hammer) and focal (I am focusing on the nail that I am hitting).&#x20;
  * When we focus on externality of object, what we are using become part of us.&#x20;
  * We learn this way too, which is why we cannot quite explain the underlying elements well because they are in our subsidiary awareness.&#x20;
* There are two kind of meaning: existential (context posses in itself, like a music) and denotative (such as a portrait).&#x20;
