# Realist Tales (Ethnography)

[Annotated Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCK4e0tZvkJkboxo3-pW4DMuyAr7iHvK/view?usp=share\_link)

## Four conventions of realist ethnography&#x20;

Experiential Author(ity)

* Author is not present in the narratives outside of logistics
* Readers have to trust author to be well-trained practitioner of ethnography&#x20;

Typical Forms&#x20;

* Focus on thoroughly mundane details of everyday life&#x20;
* Have precepts that are used to organize observations&#x20;
* Ended up suppressing the individual and favor programmatically constructing an entity to serve as a kind of cultural prototype&#x20;

The Native's Point of View

* Offer the perspective as well as practices of the member of the culture. But note we have to trust the author to interpret correctly the perspective of the natives

Interpretive Omnipotence&#x20;

* Author has the final word on the interpretation / rarely doubt the accuracy of narratives. Often use observation data to support a specific view and do not allow alternative views&#x20;
* three ways:&#x20;
  * Use existing theories to guide and map observations&#x20;
  * From observations to extract explanatory constructs&#x20;
  * Rely on higher order theories (e.g.: symbolic systems) to circumvent the timely nature of many social theories &#x20;
