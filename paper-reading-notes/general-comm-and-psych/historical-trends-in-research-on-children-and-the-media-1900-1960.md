## Abstract

Similar questions have been asked about “effects” as each new medium appeared on the scene, and precursors of current concerns with developmental and social factors were found in the period of the most research on media and children-the 1930s

## Preconceived History of Communication&#x20;

A shift from direct indifferentiated effect (e.g.: Lasswell) to indicrect and differentiated effect with various mediating roles (e.g.: Lasswell).&#x20;

## Point 1: Traditional history of American mass communication doesn't capture children and media&#x20;

* From 1900 to 1940s (the "direct effect era"), studies on children and media does not follow the direct and undifferentiated view, e.g. the 1933 Payne Fund studies concluded effect of the same film would affect children differently.&#x20;
* From 1940s to 1960s, studies on children and media does not follow the indirect effect model with mediating roles from dispositional factors. (e.g.:  work in Columbia Bureau of Applied Social Research)&#x20;

## Point 2: The origins of research about children lies in concern expressed by the public about each medium as it was introduced&#x20;

* The quantity of research shifts from one medium to another as the growth of each new medium&#x20;

## Point 3: Recurring arguments&#x20;

* Arguments display a trend of progression from studies of media use to later issues of physical, emotional harm, and changes in children's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Also studies about violence, sex, and advertising.&#x20;
