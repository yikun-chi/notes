## Motivation&#x20;

The goals of evolutionary psychologists are&#x20;

* The mapping of our universal human nature (high-resolution models of the evolved adaptations).&#x20;
* Reconstruct social sciences towards an accurate, natural science-based model of human nature, moving away from the&#x20;

The Standard Standard Social Science Model (SSSM) contains many incorrect assumptions, such as that the human learning system is general-purpose and content-independent

* Many evolutionary psychology models contradict this assumption
* Evolutionary psychology views culture as a manufactured product of our evolved neurocomputational programs situated in individuals living in groups&#x20;
* People have innate ideas&#x20;

## The Intellectual Origins of Evolutionary Psychology&#x20;

Three building blocks of evolutionary psychology

* Modern adaptationist revolution in theoretical evolutionary biology: The existence of antientropic functional organization involves the history of selection through adaptation&#x20;
* The rise of information theory and computational science: Logical operations can now be carried out mechanically and physically&#x20;
* The emergence of serious attempts to reconstruct the ancestral conditions, way of life, and research in animal behaviors.&#x20;

Evolutionary psychology's view on the environment

* People develop internal systems that generate responses to informational input, i.e., it is a system processing function.&#x20;

## Evolutionary Psychology&#x20;

Workflow:&#x20;

* Carefully specifying an adaptive information processing problem&#x20;
* Perform task analysis on the problem
* Generate hypotheses about the structure of the programs&#x20;

## Principles of Organic Design

Natural Selection is an Engineer that Designs Organic Machines&#x20;

* Genes have two primary ways of propagating: increase the probability of offspring, increase the reproduction of others who are more likely to carry the same gene (family)
* Adaptive behavior increases the frequency of the alleles underlying the behavior.
* Enduring conditions in the world that create reproductive opportunities or obstacles constitute adaptive problems.
* The environment of adaptive problems + adaptive problems = Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)&#x20;

Psychology is Reverse Engineering&#x20;

* Psychologists dissect the brain's computational architecture into functionally isolable information processing units and determine how those units operate.
* Many properties of organisms are not adaptations: adaptations vs. byproduct vs. noise&#x20;

Design Evidence&#x20;

* Research must produce evidence of a fit between the design and the proposed function.&#x20;

Theories of Good Design are a Heuristic for Discovery&#x20;

* There is a systematic method for using theories of adaptive function and principles of good design for discovering new programs

Nature and Nurture from an Adaptationist Perspective&#x20;

* Innate is not the opposite of learned
* Any learned behavior is the joint product of innate equipment interacting with environmental input.
* A function is generally specialized for a domain and can be activated after birth.&#x20;
* Behavior is caused by evolved mechanisms operate on information from the environment, so there is no need to distinguish between genetically determined vs. environment-determined.&#x20;
* Species' developmentally relevant environment is just as much the creation of the evolutionary process as the genes are&#x20;
* Adaptations can be conceptualized as operating in two different modes: functional (performing its evolved function) and organizational mode (construct the adaptation and furnish it with information)
* Selection interacting with sexual recombination tends to impose at the genetic level near uniformity in the latent or potential functional design.&#x20;
* Behavior geneticists explore the extend to which differences among individuals are accounted for by differences in their genes. Evolutionary psychologists explore the design of the universal evolved psychological and neural architecture.&#x20;
* Genetic variability tends to be predominantly nonadaptive or maladaptive.&#x20;

Evolutionary vs. traditional psychology&#x20;

* Evolutionary psychologists expect a mind paced with domain-specific, content-rich programs specialized for solving ancestral problems.&#x20;
* Each domain-specialized mechanism will be part of a vertically integrated system.&#x20;

## Computational Adaptationist Approaches to Motivation and Emotion&#x20;

Question&#x20;

1. To what degree is evolutionary account for our choices? If it is only to little degree, is the second goal useless?&#x20;
