## Main Notes

This is an early paper articulating why behavior is important in personality psychology and the pros and cons of different method available at the time.&#x20;

## Abstract

Personality psychology has been accused of neglecting behavior—of devoting insufficient attention to what people actually do. The current paper addresses four important issues regarding the study of behavior as separate from other important psychological responses—the definition of behavior, the importance of studying behavior, the strengths and weaknesses of core methods through which behavior is studied and the degree to which behavior actually has been studied in personality psychology over the past 15 years (along with information about the use of specific methods of studying behavior). Analysis of publication trends indicates that behavior is not studied to the degree it merits; furthermore, it indicates that, when behavior is studied, it is usually studied at a very generalized level relying on relatively weak methods. The current paper is offered as a starting point for focused discussion of these important issues, potentially enhancing the field's standing as a truly behavioral science.



**Definition of behavior:** verbal utterance (excluding verbal reports in psychological assessment contexts) or movements that are potentially available to careful observers using normal sensory processes.&#x20;

**Why behavior?**&#x20;

1. Behavior as the primary phenomenon to be explained in psychological research&#x20;
2. Behavior as the foundation of important theoretical phenomena in personality psychology (e.g., cross situational consistency leads to trait)&#x20;
3. Behavior as a mechanism that affects psychosocial outcomes
4. Behavior reveals the importance and nature of personality constructs and measures&#x20;
